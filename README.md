# Blobbo Globbo

A game project for [National Game Design Month 2021](https://nagademon.org/)

## Build notes

Several sound effects are found in [raw_assets/sfx.lmms], where they
are exported using the Export Tracks feature. This makes a file for
each track, and hence the numeric prefixes on them. They still have
to be manually trimmed (e.g. in Audacity) and mixed to mono for
inclusion in the game.
